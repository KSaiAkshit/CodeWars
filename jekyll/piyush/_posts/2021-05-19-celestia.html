Wondered what mass actually is? Ever thought why light is both wave and matter? Fantasized about time travel? Had nerd
dreams about black holes and the beauty inside it? Ever thought what is everything (or nothing)? Itâ€™s time to know what
is beyond the wall. Climb aboard the wandering star, itâ€™s time to explore and answer it all.
